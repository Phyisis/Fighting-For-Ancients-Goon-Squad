## Fighting For Ancients: Goon Squad

A custom gamemode for DotA2. A few heroes have been overwritten to have custom abilites to match the playstyle of friends. 

### How to Install

Create an empty addon with the DotA2 tools provided by valve. Copy the contents of the "content" and "game" folders into your new addon's respective folders under the dota 2 beta game folder on your harddrive.

### How to Run

* Run DoTA2
* Open Console and type "dota_launch_custom_game [your addon name] dota"

This will launch the custom game on the default "dota" map.

### How to add bots

* Make sure cheats are enabled, and type "spawnbots" in the chat in-game. It will populate the game with unfair bots.
